# Employee Work Analysis

This repository contains a program to analyze employee work data from a CSV file. The program identifies employees who meet specific criteria such as consecutive days worked, time between shifts, and excessive single-shift hours.

## Assignment Details

As part of the internship application process for Bluejay Delivery , I completed the following tasks:

1. **Program Description:** The program takes an input CSV file containing employee work data and performs the following analyses:
    - Identifies employees who have worked for 7 consecutive days.
    - Identifies employees who have less than 10 hours of time between shifts but greater than 1 hour.
    - Identifies employees who have worked for more than 14 hours in a single shift.

2. **Clean Code:** The codebase is written in C++ , follows best practices, and includes code comments for clarity. Assumptions made during development are documented.

3. **Git Repository:** The codebase and the output file are pushed to this public GitHub repository for review.
